CAMP - Candidate Assignment Manage Portal
=====================================
In this nodejs Application you can assign task to any volunteer, and manage volunteer and Volunteer can view the task or assignments and complete it in time. 

#### How It Works.
- In this nodejs Application there is a file called create admin first of all you have to change name of admin and password according to your need.
- Then you have to run that particular file with ``` node createAdmin.js ``` command.
- Now you can run the file with ``` node server.js``` or ``` nodemon server.js ``` command.
- Now in your browser You see Admin login link clink on it and fill the credentials
- Now after logging in you will see all links which was not visible priviously.
- Now you can add Volunteer or assign task or create task and many more.
- Thanks.
